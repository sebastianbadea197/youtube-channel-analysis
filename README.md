## Description

A project analysing the engagement of 10 popular urban planning youtube channels on Youtube, using the Youtube API.

## How to run

Checkout the file `youtube_channel_analysis.ipynb` in order to see the analysis.
In order to run the file on a personal computer a Youtube API key will be needed. Place it in a .env file.
An environment file containing the packages used is present as environment.yml. 
**Note** that installing both the google-api library and the pytorch library results in library version conflicts. As such, a separate virtual environment will be needed in order to run the deep learning libraries.
